#Emoji Statistics
On my quest to teach myself machine learning, I decided to make a quick statistics experiement on which emojis are most widely used on Twitter. I consume live tweets from San Fransisco in a batch of 1000 and then plot the occurences of emojis on a bar chart.

The results? People love these three emojis the most (in order):
###:heart_eyes:
###:joy:
###:sob:

Want to run it yourself? Cool. You'll need matplotlib and twython installed.

> $ pip install matplotlib
> $ pip install twython

After that, add your Twitter App API credentials and you're good to go!
